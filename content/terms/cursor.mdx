## The Plain English Version

Imagine Microsoft Word, but for code, and it has a genius assistant built right in. You can highlight a section and say "make this faster," or type "build me a login page," and it just... does it. That's Cursor.

Cursor is a code editor (based on VS Code, the most popular one) that has AI baked into every corner. It can write code, explain code, fix bugs, refactor files, and even understand your entire project. It's one of the tools that makes vibe coding possible — you describe what you want in plain English, and it translates that into working code.

It's not perfect. Sometimes it writes code that doesn't work. Sometimes it misunderstands what you want. But honestly, it gets it right enough of the time that the productivity boost is insane. Tasks that used to take hours now take minutes.

## Why Should You Care?

Because Cursor (and tools like it) are the reason non-programmers can now build software. If you've ever had an app idea but thought "I'd need to learn to code first," Cursor changes that equation. You still need to understand what you're building, but the AI handles the actual typing.

## The Nerd Version (if you dare)

Cursor is a fork of VS Code that integrates LLM capabilities directly into the editing experience. It supports multiple AI models (GPT-4, Claude), offers inline completions (Tab), a chat panel for complex requests, and a Composer feature for multi-file edits. It uses codebase indexing for context-aware suggestions and supports @-mentions for files, docs, and web searches.
