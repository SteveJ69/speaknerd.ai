## The Plain English Version

Imagine walking into a construction site and saying, "I want a house with three bedrooms, a big kitchen, and a wraparound porch." And then a crew of expert builders just... builds it. You don't need to know how to frame a wall or run electrical. You just describe what you want, watch it happen, and say "actually, make that kitchen bigger."

That's vibe coding. You describe what you want an app to do, and an AI writes the actual code for you. You don't need a computer science degree. You don't need to memorize programming languages. You just need to know what you want to build and be able to describe it clearly.

I'm living proof it works. I'm in my 50s, never took a programming class, and I've built multiple working web applications using nothing but AI coding tools and stubborn curiosity. A year ago, I didn't know what a "function" was. Now I ship apps.

## Why Should You Care?

Because the barrier to building software just dropped to near zero. If you have an idea for an app, a website, or a tool — you can actually build it now. Not "someday when you learn to code." Now. Today. This weekend. Vibe coding is the great equalizer, and it's only getting better.

## The Nerd Version (if you dare)

Vibe coding leverages AI-powered code generation tools (like Cursor, Windsurf, or Claude Code) that use LLMs to translate natural language descriptions into functional code. The developer acts as a product manager — specifying requirements, reviewing output, and iterating — while the AI handles syntax, boilerplate, and implementation details. It's sometimes called "AI-assisted development" in more formal contexts.
