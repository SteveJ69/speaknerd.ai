## The Plain English Version

Remember how deploying used to mean renting servers, configuring them, and praying nothing breaks? Vercel said "what if we just... made that easy?"

Vercel is a hosting platform. You connect it to your code on GitHub, and every time you push changes, Vercel automatically builds your site and puts it on the internet. That's it. No server management. No configuration headaches. Push code, get a live URL in about 60 seconds.

They also created Next.js, one of the most popular web frameworks. So Vercel and Next.js work together like peanut butter and jelly. But Vercel can host pretty much any frontend framework.

## Why Should You Care?

Because Vercel removes one of the scariest parts of building a website — getting it online. If you're vibe coding a project, Vercel means you can focus on building features instead of figuring out servers. The free tier handles personal projects and small sites easily, so there's zero cost to get started.

## The Nerd Version (if you dare)

Vercel is a cloud platform for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. It offers: automatic Git-based CI/CD, global edge network (CDN), serverless and edge functions, image optimization, analytics, and preview deployments per pull request. It supports Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Astro, and more. Pricing scales with bandwidth and function invocations. Alternatives include Netlify and Cloudflare Pages.
