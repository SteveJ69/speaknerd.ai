## The Plain English Version

Cursor and Windsurf are like AI assistants that live inside your code editor. Claude Code takes a different approach — it lives in your terminal (that black screen with the blinking cursor that hackers use in movies).

You point Claude Code at your project, describe what you want in plain English, and it reads your files, understands your codebase, writes new code, edits existing code, runs tests, and even commits changes. It's like having a developer sitting next to you who can see your entire project and just... does things.

The wild part? This entire website — SpeakNerd.ai — was built with significant help from Claude Code. I described what I wanted, and it built pages, wrote terms, and wired everything together. The tool that explains AI tools was built by an AI tool. We live in interesting times.

## Why Should You Care?

Because Claude Code represents where vibe coding is heading — AI that doesn't just write snippets but works on entire projects. It can create files, edit multiple files at once, understand how everything connects, and make changes across your whole codebase. For serious building, it's one of the most powerful tools available.

## The Nerd Version (if you dare)

Claude Code is Anthropic's CLI-based agentic coding tool. It reads project files, understands context via large context windows (200K tokens), and can execute multi-step coding tasks. It supports file creation/editing, git operations, terminal commands, and iterative development. It integrates with VS Code via an extension. Unlike editor-based tools, it operates at the project level rather than file level.
