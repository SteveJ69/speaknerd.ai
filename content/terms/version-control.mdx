## The Plain English Version

Have you ever saved over a file and immediately regretted it? Or had a project going great, then made a bunch of changes that broke everything, and wished you could just go back? Version control is the "undo button" for your entire project — but infinitely more powerful.

It tracks every single change anyone makes, who made it, and when. You can rewind to any point in history. You can see exactly what changed between two versions. You can create parallel "branches" to try out ideas without risking the working version. If the experiment fails? Delete the branch. If it works? Merge it in.

Git is the version control system that basically everyone uses. Created by Linus Torvalds (the same person who created Linux) because he was frustrated with existing tools. GitHub is the most popular website for hosting Git repositories. Together, they're how millions of developers collaborate on software — from two-person startups to teams of thousands at Google and Microsoft.

## Why Should You Care?

Because version control isn't just for professional developers anymore. Anyone building a website, writing a book, or managing documents can benefit from never losing work. And if you're getting into vibe coding — building apps with AI — understanding version control (even the basics of commit, push, pull) is essential. It's your safety net.

## The Nerd Version (if you dare)

Version control systems (VCS) track changes to files over time using snapshots (Git) or deltas (SVN). Git is a distributed VCS where each clone contains the full repository history. Core concepts: working directory, staging area, commits (DAG of snapshots), branches (lightweight pointers), and merges (three-way merge, fast-forward). Collaboration workflows include feature branches, pull requests, code review, and CI/CD triggers on push. Git internals use SHA-1 hashed objects (blobs, trees, commits, tags) stored in .git/objects.
