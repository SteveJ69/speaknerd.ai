## The Plain English Version

When two people share information, they use a language they both understand. When two computers share information, they often use JSON (pronounced "jay-son"). It stands for JavaScript Object Notation, but don't let the name scare you — it's just a way of organizing data that both humans and computers can read.

Here's what JSON looks like:

```
{
  "name": "Steve",
  "age": 52,
  "hobbies": ["robotics", "AI", "coffee"]
}
```

See? It's not that scary. Curly braces hold objects, quotes hold text, brackets hold lists. The key is on the left, the value is on the right. Even if you've never seen code before, you can probably figure out what that says.

JSON won the internet because it's simple, lightweight, and every programming language can read and write it. Every time an app loads data — weather, social media posts, your shopping cart — there's a good chance JSON is carrying that data behind the scenes. It's the envelope that information travels in.

## Why Should You Care?

Because JSON is the data format you're most likely to encounter if you interact with any AI API, web service, or data tool. When you connect apps together, export data, or work with AI responses programmatically — it's usually JSON. Being able to read it (even roughly) gives you a superpower when working with any technical tool.

## The Nerd Version (if you dare)

JSON is a lightweight, text-based data interchange format derived from JavaScript object literal syntax but language-independent. It supports strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, and nested objects. JSON Schema provides validation. Alternatives include YAML (superset, human-friendly), XML (verbose, legacy), Protocol Buffers (binary, fast), and MessagePack (binary JSON). JSON parsing is available natively in most languages. JSONL (newline-delimited) is used for streaming and log data.
