## The Plain English Version

You don't memorize phone numbers anymore — you just tap a name in your contacts and your phone looks up the number. DNS (Domain Name System) does the same thing for the internet. You type "google.com" and DNS translates that into the actual numerical address (like 142.250.80.46) that computers use to find each other.

Without DNS, you'd need to memorize strings of numbers for every website you visit. "Let me check the news at 151.101.1.67." "Time to browse social media at 157.240.1.35." Nobody would use the internet. DNS is what makes it human-friendly.

Here's how it works: you type a URL, your computer asks a DNS server "where is google.com?", the DNS server says "142.250.80.46", and your browser connects to that address. This happens in milliseconds, dozens of times per page load, and you never notice it. Until DNS breaks — then NOTHING works and everyone panics.

## Why Should You Care?

Because DNS is one of the most fundamental (and fragile) pieces of internet infrastructure. When "the internet is down" but your WiFi is fine, it's often a DNS problem. Companies like Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) and Google (8.8.8.8) offer free DNS that's faster and more private than your ISP's default. Switching to them is one of the easiest ways to speed up your internet.

## The Nerd Version (if you dare)

DNS is a hierarchical, distributed naming system that resolves domain names to IP addresses. The resolution chain goes: browser cache → OS cache → recursive resolver → root nameservers → TLD nameservers → authoritative nameservers. Record types include A (IPv4), AAAA (IPv6), CNAME (alias), MX (mail), TXT (verification/SPF/DKIM), NS (nameserver), and SRV (service location). DNSSEC adds cryptographic authentication. DNS propagation (TTL-based) explains update delays. DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) and DNS-over-TLS (DoT) encrypt queries for privacy.
