## The Plain English Version

A chatbot answers your questions. An AI agent does your errands.

Think of it this way: ChatGPT is like a really smart friend sitting on the couch giving you advice. "You should book a flight, then get a hotel, then reserve a restaurant." Helpful! But you still have to do all of it. An AI agent is like a personal assistant who hears "plan me a trip to Paris" and actually books the flight, reserves the hotel, and makes dinner reservations. It doesn't just think — it acts.

AI agents can browse the web, write and run code, send emails, manage files, call APIs, and chain together multiple steps to accomplish a goal. They're the next evolution beyond chatbots — moving from "AI that talks" to "AI that works." Some can even figure out the steps on their own without you spelling it out.

## Why Should You Care?

Because AI agents are about to change how work gets done. Instead of spending 30 minutes doing a multi-step task yourself, you describe what you want and the agent handles it. The people who learn to work WITH agents will get dramatically more done than those who don't. This is the shift from "AI as a tool" to "AI as a coworker."

## The Nerd Version (if you dare)

AI agents are autonomous systems that use LLMs as reasoning engines combined with tool use capabilities (function calling, code execution, web browsing). They employ planning strategies like ReAct (Reasoning + Acting), chain-of-thought prompting, and tree-of-thought search. Key frameworks include LangChain, AutoGen, and CrewAI. Agent architectures typically involve a loop of observe → think → act → observe.
