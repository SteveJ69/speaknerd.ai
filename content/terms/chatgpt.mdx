## The Plain English Version

ChatGPT is the reason you're reading this site. Before it launched in November 2022, AI was something that existed in research labs and sci-fi movies. Then OpenAI made a website where anyone could talk to an AI, and the entire world lost its mind.

It's essentially a chat interface for GPT (the AI engine underneath). You type something, it responds. You can ask it questions, have it write emails, help with homework, brainstorm ideas, debug code, write poems, explain complex topics — basically anything that involves language.

Think of it as the world's most well-read intern. It's read basically everything on the internet. It's incredibly helpful, occasionally wrong, and always confident. It doesn't know what happened after its training cutoff, it can't browse the web on its own (well, now it can with plugins), and it sometimes makes things up. But for the 90% of the time it gets things right, it feels like having a genius assistant on call 24/7.

## Why Should You Care?

Because ChatGPT is probably the most practical AI tool you can start using right now. It's free (the basic version), it runs in your browser, and it can save you hours every week if you learn to use it well. Writing emails, summarizing documents, brainstorming ideas, learning new topics — it's genuinely useful, and the gap between people who use it well and people who don't is getting wider every day.

## The Nerd Version (if you dare)

ChatGPT is built on OpenAI's GPT series (currently GPT-4o and GPT-4 Turbo). It uses RLHF to align outputs with human preferences. The free tier uses GPT-4o mini, while Plus ($20/month) gives access to GPT-4o with higher usage limits. It supports plugins, code execution, image generation (DALL-E), and web browsing.
