## The Plain English Version

You know how your phone predicts the next word when you're texting? Copilot does that for code. You start typing, and it suggests the rest of the line — or the rest of the entire function. Accept the suggestion with a Tab key, and you just wrote code 5x faster.

GitHub Copilot was one of the first AI coding tools to go mainstream. It lives inside your code editor (VS Code, usually) and watches what you type. Based on the context — the file you're in, the code around your cursor, the comments you've written — it predicts what you're trying to do and offers to write it for you.

It's not as powerful as tools like Cursor or Claude Code (which can handle complex multi-file tasks), but for line-by-line coding, it's like having an experienced programmer whispering suggestions in your ear.

## Why Should You Care?

Because Copilot was the gateway drug that showed the world AI could write code. It normalized the idea that AI assistance is a tool, not cheating. If you're just starting to explore vibe coding, Copilot is a gentle on-ramp — it helps without taking over.

## The Nerd Version (if you dare)

GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI's Codex model (a GPT variant fine-tuned on code). It provides inline completions, chat-based assistance, and CLI suggestions. Copilot X added GPT-4 capabilities. Pricing: $10/month individual, free for students and open-source maintainers. Competitors include Codeium (free), Tabnine, and Amazon CodeWhisperer. Copilot Workspace enables multi-file, task-driven development.
