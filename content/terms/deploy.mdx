## The Plain English Version

You've built an app. It works on your computer. Great. But right now, you're the only person who can use it. Deploying is the process of putting it on the internet so anyone with the link can access it.

Think of it like cooking a meal at home vs. opening a restaurant. The food might be the same, but serving it to the public requires a whole different setup — a location, a kitchen that can handle volume, a way for people to find you.

Deploying used to be a nightmare. You needed to rent servers, configure them, manage security, handle traffic spikes. Now? Services like Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, and Netlify have made it almost magical. Push your code, click a button, and your site is live at a real URL in about 60 seconds. This is the golden age of deployment, and it's one of the reasons vibe coding works — getting your creation in front of people is trivially easy.

## Why Should You Care?

Because deploying is the moment your project goes from "hobby" to "real." It's the most satisfying moment in building anything — seeing your creation live on the internet with a real URL you can share. And with modern tools, there's genuinely no excuse not to ship.

## The Nerd Version (if you dare)

Deployment involves building, testing, and publishing applications to production environments. Modern approaches include static hosting (Cloudflare Pages, Netlify), serverless (Vercel, AWS Lambda), container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker), and PaaS (Heroku, Railway). CI/CD pipelines automate the build-test-deploy cycle. Concepts like blue-green deployments, canary releases, and rollbacks ensure safe updates.
