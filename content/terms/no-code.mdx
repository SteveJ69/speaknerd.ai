## The Plain English Version

You know how Squarespace lets you build a website without knowing HTML? Drag a photo here, add some text there, choose a template, done. No-code tools do the same thing but for full applications — databases, user accounts, workflows, and all.

Tools like Bubble, Webflow, and Airtable let you build surprisingly complex apps without writing a single line of code. You design the interface visually, set up logic with flowcharts instead of code, and connect to databases with clicks instead of queries.

Low-code is the middle ground — you mostly use visual tools, but you can drop into actual code when you need to do something custom. Vibe coding is sort of the next evolution: instead of visual drag-and-drop, you describe what you want to an AI and it writes the code.

## Why Should You Care?

Because no-code tools are genuinely powerful for MVPs and simple apps. If your idea doesn't need custom code, no-code might get you to launch faster than anything else. But they have limits — when you need something truly custom, you'll either need to learn vibe coding or hire a developer. Know the tools, know the tradeoffs.

## The Nerd Version (if you dare)

No-code platforms abstract programming into visual interfaces. Leaders include Bubble (web apps), Webflow (websites), Airtable (databases), Zapier (automation), and Retool (internal tools). Limitations include vendor lock-in, performance ceilings, and reduced flexibility. Low-code platforms like OutSystems and Mendix target enterprise. The "no-code to pro-code" pipeline is common: prototype in no-code, rebuild in code when you outgrow it.
