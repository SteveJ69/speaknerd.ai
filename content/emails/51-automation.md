# SpeakNerd Weekly #51: Automation

**Subject line:** Making your computer do the boring stuff (forever)

---

Hey — Steve here.

Last week we covered **Deploy**. This week, let's talk about something you've probably heard but maybe never fully understood.

## This Week's Term: Automation

**The quick version:** Making computers do repetitive tasks so you don't have to. If you copy-paste the same data between apps every day, that's a job for automation, not a human.

**The deeper version:**

Every day, millions of people do the same boring tasks on their computers: copy data from one spreadsheet to another, send the same follow-up email, rename and organize files, update a report with new numbers. They do it manually, every single time, like it's 1995.

Automation means making the computer do these repetitive tasks for you. "Every time a customer fills out a form, automatically add them to the spreadsheet, send them a welcome email, and notify the sales team on Slack." Instead of doing three things manually, you set it up once and the computer handles it forever.

The tools range from simple (Zapier connects apps with if-this-then-that rules) to advanced (Python scripts that do complex data processing) to AI-powered (agents that can handle unpredictable tasks). The principle is always the same: identify something you do repeatedly and make a computer do it instead.

## Why This Matters

Because time spent on repetitive tasks is time you'll never get back. Even automating ONE daily task that takes 15 minutes saves you over 60 hours a year. That's almost two full work weeks! And with AI and no-code tools, you don't need to be a programmer to automate anymore. If you can describe the process, you can probably automate it.

## Try It Yourself (2 minutes)

Think about one repetitive daily task. Go to zapier.com and search for it. There's probably already a template for it.

## The Nerd Corner

Automation spans multiple layers: task automation (scripts, cron jobs, scheduled tasks), workflow automation (Zapier, Make, n8n, Temporal), infrastructure automation (Terraform, Ansible, CI/CD pipelines), and AI-powered automation (agents, RPA with AI). Key concepts include triggers, actions, conditions, error handling, idempotency, and monitoring. The automation spectrum runs from rule-based (deterministic) to AI-driven (probabilistic). Modern approaches combine webhooks, APIs, and AI agents for complex multi-step workflows.
