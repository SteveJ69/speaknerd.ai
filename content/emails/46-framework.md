# SpeakNerd Weekly #46: Framework

**Subject line:** Why developers don't build everything from scratch

---

Hey — Steve here.

Last week we covered **Database**. This week, let's talk about something you've probably heard but maybe never fully understood.

## This Week's Term: Framework

**The quick version:** Pre-built code that gives you a head start. Like buying a house with the foundation already poured instead of starting from dirt.

**The deeper version:**

Imagine you want to build a house. You could start from absolute scratch — dig the foundation, pour concrete, frame every wall. Or you could start with a pre-built foundation and frame, and just customize it.

A framework is that pre-built foundation for software. Instead of writing every single piece of code from scratch, a framework gives you a structure to build on. It handles the boring, repetitive stuff so you can focus on what makes your app unique.

Next.js is a framework for building websites. Django is a framework for building backends. React is a framework for building user interfaces. Each one has opinions about how things should be organized, gives you tools and shortcuts, and saves you hundreds of hours of reinventing the wheel.

## Why This Matters

Because when someone says "what framework should I use?" they're really asking "what foundation should I build on?" Picking the right framework matters. It determines what's easy, what's hard, and what community of developers can help you when you get stuck. If you're vibe coding, your AI tool will need to know which framework you're using.

## Try It Yourself (2 minutes)

Search "made with React" or "built with Next.js" — thousands of sites use the same framework. It provides structure so devs can focus on what's unique.

## The Nerd Corner

Frameworks provide opinionated structures for building applications. Frontend: React, Vue, Svelte, Angular. Full-stack: Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit. Backend: Express, Django, FastAPI, Rails. They typically include routing, state management, build tooling, and deployment patterns. Frameworks differ from libraries in that they control the flow — you plug into them, not the other way around (inversion of control).
