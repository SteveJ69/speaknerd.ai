# SpeakNerd Weekly #1: Prompt

**Subject line:** The one skill that separates AI rookies from AI power users

---

Hey — Steve here. Welcome to SpeakNerd Weekly.

Every week, I'm going to teach you one AI concept in plain English. No jargon. No PhD required. Just one thing, explained so well you could turn around and explain it to someone else.

Let's start with the most important one.

## This Week's Term: Prompt

**The quick version:** A prompt is just the thing you type into an AI tool. That's it. But HOW you type it changes everything.

**The deeper version:**

You know how talking to a really smart person still doesn't help if you ask a vague question? "What should I do with my life?" gets you a shrug. "I'm 35, in marketing, bored, good at writing, and curious about tech — what career moves should I consider?" gets you gold.

AI is the same way. The prompt is your input — and the quality of what comes out depends almost entirely on the quality of what goes in.

Here's a real example:

❌ **Bad prompt:** "Write me a marketing email."
✅ **Good prompt:** "Write a marketing email for a small coffee shop announcing a new oat milk latte. Tone: casual and friendly. Target audience: local regulars. Include a 10% discount code. Keep it under 150 words."

Same AI. Wildly different results. The second prompt gives the AI context, constraints, and direction. That's the whole game.

## Try It Yourself (2 minutes)

Open [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) or [Claude](https://claude.ai) and try these two prompts:

1. "Tell me about dogs"
2. "I'm considering getting my first dog. I live in a small apartment, work from home, and want a calm breed that doesn't shed much. What are my top 3 options and why?"

Notice the difference in the responses. That's the power of a good prompt.

## The Nerd Corner

In the AI world, "prompt engineering" has become its own discipline. Techniques like chain-of-thought prompting (asking AI to think step by step), few-shot prompting (giving examples in your prompt), and system prompts (hidden instructions that set behavior) can dramatically improve results. Some companies pay six figures for prompt engineers. Not bad for "just typing stuff."
