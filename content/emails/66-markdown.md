# SpeakNerd Weekly #66: Markdown

**Subject line:** The lazy person's way to format text (and it's brilliant)

---

Hey — Steve here.

Last week we covered **Debugging**. This week, let's talk about something you've probably heard but maybe never fully understood.

## This Week's Term: Markdown

**The quick version:** A dead-simple way to format text using symbols like # for headings and ** for bold. You've probably used it on Reddit or Discord without knowing its name.

**The deeper version:**

Want to make text **bold** in a Word document? You highlight it and click a button. Want to make text bold in Markdown? You put two asterisks around it: `**bold**`. That's it. No buttons, no menus, no mouse required.

Markdown is a lightweight way to format text using simple symbols. `#` makes a heading. `**text**` makes it bold. `*text*` makes it italic. `-` makes a bullet point. It was created in 2004 to let people write formatted text quickly without taking their hands off the keyboard or dealing with complex formatting tools.

You've probably already used Markdown without knowing it. Reddit comments? Markdown. Discord messages? Markdown. GitHub README files? Markdown. Notion? Markdown. It's become the unofficial standard for writing on the internet because it's so simple that you can learn the basics in about 2 minutes.

## Why This Matters

Because Markdown is everywhere in the tech world, and it takes literally 5 minutes to learn. If you're writing on GitHub, Discord, Slack, Notion, Reddit, or countless other platforms — knowing Markdown makes your text look better with zero effort. It's also how most AI tools format their responses, so understanding it helps you communicate better with AI too.

## Try It Yourself (2 minutes)

In a notes app, try writing: **bold**, *italic*, # Heading. If it renders formatted? It supports Markdown.

## The Nerd Corner

Markdown (created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004) converts plain text with formatting syntax to HTML. CommonMark standardizes the spec. Extended flavors include GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) with tables, task lists, and code fencing, and MDX (Markdown + JSX) for embedding React components. Parsers include remark, marked, and markdown-it. Markdown is used for documentation (README.md), static site generators (Gatsby, Next.js), note-taking (Obsidian), and content management.
