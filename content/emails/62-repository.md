# SpeakNerd Weekly #62: Repository

**Subject line:** Your project's home (and time machine)

---

Hey — Steve here.

Last week we covered **GitHub**. This week, let's talk about something you've probably heard but maybe never fully understood.

## This Week's Term: Repository

**The quick version:** A project folder that remembers every change ever made. Like Google Docs version history, but for your entire codebase. Usually called a 'repo' for short.

**The deeper version:**

A regular folder on your computer is dumb. Save a file, and the old version is gone forever. Delete something by accident? Tough luck. A repository (repo for short) is a smart folder. It remembers everything — every change, every addition, every deletion. And you can go back to any point in time.

Imagine if your Documents folder kept a perfect record of every edit you've ever made to every file. "Show me what this file looked like last Tuesday." "Undo everything I did this week." "What exactly changed between version 5 and version 12?" A repo does all of that. It's like a time machine for your project.

Repos are stored on platforms like GitHub, where they're not just version-controlled — they're also shareable. Multiple people can work on the same repo, each making their own changes, and the system figures out how to merge everything together. It's how teams of thousands of developers build software together without constantly overwriting each other's work.

## Why This Matters

Because if you ever build anything with code — even a simple website — a repository will save your sanity. Made a mistake? Roll it back. Want to try something risky? Create a branch (a safe copy) and experiment without fear. Plus, your GitHub profile is essentially your coding resume — it shows what you've built and how you work.

## Try It Yourself (2 minutes)

Visit github.com/facebook/react. Click "commits" to see every change ever made. Click one to see exactly what changed.

## The Nerd Corner

A repository is a data structure storing file versions, metadata, and history managed by a version control system (primarily Git). It contains the working tree, staging area (index), and object database (commits, trees, blobs). Operations include clone, pull, push, branch, merge, rebase, and cherry-pick. Remote repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) enable collaboration. Key concepts: commit hashes (SHA-1), branching strategies (Git Flow, trunk-based), pull requests, code review, and CI/CD integration.
