# SpeakNerd Weekly #47: The Cloud

**Subject line:** Someone else's computer (and why that's amazing)

---

Hey — Steve here.

Last week we covered **Framework**. This week, let's talk about something you've probably heard but maybe never fully understood.

## This Week's Term: The Cloud

**The quick version:** It's just someone else's computer that you rent. When someone says 'it's in the cloud,' they mean it's stored on a server in a data center somewhere. That's it.

**The deeper version:**

"The cloud" is one of the most over-mystified terms in tech. Ready for the truth? It's just someone else's computer. That's it. When your photos are "in the cloud," they're on a computer in a massive data center owned by Apple, Google, or Amazon. When a company says their software "runs in the cloud," it means it runs on rented servers instead of computers in their own office.

Picture a giant warehouse full of thousands of computers, all humming away, kept cool by industrial air conditioning. That's a data center. Amazon (AWS), Microsoft (Azure), and Google (GCP) have these warehouses all over the world. Instead of buying your own expensive computers, you rent space on theirs. Need more power? Rent more. Need less? Scale down. That's cloud computing.

The genius of the cloud isn't the technology — it's the business model. You went from "buy a $50,000 server and pray nothing breaks" to "pay $50/month and let someone else worry about it." That's why startups can build apps used by millions without owning a single server.

## Why This Matters

Because almost everything you use runs on the cloud. Gmail, Netflix, Spotify, your banking app, every AI tool — all cloud-based. Understanding the cloud helps you understand why services go down sometimes (the data center had a problem), why your data privacy matters (your stuff is on someone ELSE's computer), and why companies love the subscription model so much.

## Try It Yourself (2 minutes)

If you use Google Drive or iCloud, your files are on someone else's computer in a data center. But accessible from anywhere. That's the cloud.

## The Nerd Corner

Cloud computing provides on-demand access to computing resources (compute, storage, networking) via the internet. Service models include IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service — raw VMs), PaaS (Platform as a Service — managed platforms like Heroku), and SaaS (Software as a Service — end-user applications). Major providers are AWS, Azure, and GCP. Key concepts include auto-scaling, load balancing, regions/availability zones, CDNs, and the shared responsibility model for security.
