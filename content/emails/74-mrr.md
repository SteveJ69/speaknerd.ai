# SpeakNerd Weekly #74: MRR

**Subject line:** The number that makes or breaks your startup

---

Hey — Steve here.

Last week we covered **Product-Market Fit**. This week, let's talk about something you've probably heard but maybe never fully understood.

## This Week's Term: MRR

**The quick version:** How much money your subscription business makes every month like clockwork. The number that makes investors excited.

**The deeper version:**

Imagine you have 100 customers each paying $10/month for your software. Your MRR is $1,000. Next month, if nobody cancels, that $1,000 shows up again automatically. That's the beauty of recurring revenue — you don't have to re-sell anything.

MRR is the holy grail metric for subscription businesses. It tells you exactly how much money is coming in every month, like clockwork. Investors love it because it's predictable. Founders love it because it compounds — every new customer adds to the pile that's already paying.

When tech people brag on Twitter about "hitting $10K MRR," they're saying their app is earning $10,000 every month from subscriptions. It's the scoreboard of the SaaS game.

## Why This Matters

Because if you're building any kind of subscription product — even a simple newsletter with a paid tier — MRR is how you measure success. It's also the number that tells you whether you can quit your day job. $10K MRR = $120K/year. That's the dream for a lot of solo builders.

## Try It Yourself (2 minutes)

Pick a SaaS you use: estimate $10/month x 1 million users = $10M MRR. That's the number investors care about most.

## The Nerd Corner

MRR = sum of all monthly subscription revenue, normalized to a monthly period (annual plans divided by 12). Key variants: New MRR (new customers), Expansion MRR (upgrades), Churned MRR (cancellations), Net New MRR (new + expansion - churned). ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) = MRR × 12. Healthy SaaS companies aim for >5% month-over-month MRR growth.
