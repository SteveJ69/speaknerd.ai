# SpeakNerd Weekly #25: Embedding

**Subject line:** How AI understands that "king" and "queen" are related

---

Hey — Steve here.

Last week we covered **Multimodal**. This week, let's talk about something you've probably heard but maybe never fully understood.

## This Week's Term: Embedding

**The quick version:** Converting words, images, or anything into a list of numbers that captures their meaning. It's how AI knows 'happy' and 'joyful' are close but 'happy' and 'refrigerator' aren't.

**The deeper version:**

How do you explain to a computer that "happy" and "joyful" mean basically the same thing, but "happy" and "toaster" don't? Computers don't understand words — they understand numbers. So you need a way to turn meaning into math.

That's what embeddings do. They convert things (words, sentences, images, whatever) into long lists of numbers — called vectors — where similar things end up with similar numbers. Imagine a map where every word has a location. "Happy" and "joyful" are neighbors. "Happy" and "sad" are on opposite sides. "Happy" and "refrigerator" are in completely different neighborhoods. Embeddings create that map.

This sounds nerdy (because it is), but it's the secret sauce behind a ton of AI features you use daily. How does Spotify know that if you like this song, you'll like that song? Embeddings. How does Google understand that your search for "cheap flights" should also show results about "affordable airfare"? Embeddings. It's meaning, converted to math.

## Why This Matters

Because embeddings are the hidden technology that makes AI feel smart. They're why search engines understand your intent, why recommendation systems work, and why AI can find relevant information even when you don't use the exact right words. If you ever build anything with AI, embeddings will be one of the first concepts you actually use.

## Try It Yourself (2 minutes)

Check your Spotify or Netflix recommendations. They're based on embeddings — your taste mapped into mathematical space.

## The Nerd Corner

Embeddings are dense vector representations in high-dimensional space (typically 256-4096 dimensions) generated by neural networks. Models like OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002, Cohere's embed, or open-source alternatives (BGE, E5) encode semantic meaning where cosine similarity between vectors approximates semantic similarity. Embeddings are foundational to RAG systems, semantic search, clustering, and recommendation engines.
