# SpeakNerd Weekly #50: Deploy

**Subject line:** The moment your code goes from "it works on my laptop" to live

---

Hey — Steve here.

Last week we covered **Docker**. This week, let's talk about something you've probably heard but maybe never fully understood.

## This Week's Term: Deploy

**The quick version:** Taking your app from 'works on my computer' to 'works for everyone on the internet.' The moment it gets real.

**The deeper version:**

You've built an app. It works on your computer. Great. But right now, you're the only person who can use it. Deploying is the process of putting it on the internet so anyone with the link can access it.

Think of it like cooking a meal at home vs. opening a restaurant. The food might be the same, but serving it to the public requires a whole different setup — a location, a kitchen that can handle volume, a way for people to find you.

Deploying used to be a nightmare. You needed to rent servers, configure them, manage security, handle traffic spikes. Now? Services like Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, and Netlify have made it almost magical. Push your code, click a button, and your site is live at a real URL in about 60 seconds. This is the golden age of deployment, and it's one of the reasons vibe coding works — getting your creation in front of people is trivially easy.

## Why This Matters

Because deploying is the moment your project goes from "hobby" to "real." It's the most satisfying moment in building anything — seeing your creation live on the internet with a real URL you can share. And with modern tools, there's genuinely no excuse not to ship.

## Try It Yourself (2 minutes)

Push a simple HTML file to GitHub with Pages enabled. In 60 seconds, your code goes from laptop to live URL. That's deployment.

## The Nerd Corner

Deployment involves building, testing, and publishing applications to production environments. Modern approaches include static hosting (Cloudflare Pages, Netlify), serverless (Vercel, AWS Lambda), container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker), and PaaS (Heroku, Railway). CI/CD pipelines automate the build-test-deploy cycle. Concepts like blue-green deployments, canary releases, and rollbacks ensure safe updates.
