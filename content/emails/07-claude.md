# SpeakNerd Weekly #7: Claude

**Subject line:** ChatGPT's quieter, smarter cousin

---

Hey — Steve here.

Last week we covered **ChatGPT**. This week, let's talk about something you've probably heard but maybe never fully understood.

## This Week's Term: Claude

**The quick version:** Anthropic's AI assistant. Like ChatGPT's more careful, thoughtful cousin who actually reads the whole document.

**The deeper version:**

If ChatGPT is the fast-talking salesman who always has an answer, Claude is the thoughtful friend who actually pauses to think before responding. Made by a company called Anthropic (founded by former OpenAI researchers), Claude is an AI assistant that's known for being careful, nuanced, and really good at long, complex tasks.

Where Claude really shines is handling big documents. You can drop in an entire book, a 50-page legal contract, or a massive codebase, and Claude will actually work through it carefully. It's also known for being more honest about what it doesn't know — less likely to confidently make things up.

Fun fact: the site you're reading right now was built with significant help from Claude (specifically Claude Code, the coding version). I use it alongside ChatGPT — different tools for different jobs.

## Why This Matters

Because having options matters. ChatGPT is great, but it's not the only game in town. Claude is often better for long-form writing, careful analysis, and coding tasks. Smart AI users try multiple tools and use whichever one works best for a given task. It's like having both a hammer and a screwdriver — they do different things well.

## Try It Yourself (2 minutes)

Go to claude.ai and give Claude a long paragraph. Ask it to "find the logical flaw in this argument." Claude's analytical reasoning is where it really shines.

## The Nerd Corner

Claude is built on Anthropic's constitutional AI approach, which uses a set of principles to guide model behavior. Current models (Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Claude Opus 4.6) support up to 200K token context windows. Claude emphasizes safety, honesty, and helpfulness. Claude Code is a CLI tool for AI-assisted software development. Anthropic's API uses a messages-based format.
