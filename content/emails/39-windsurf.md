# SpeakNerd Weekly #39: Windsurf

**Subject line:** Another AI code editor enters the ring

---

Hey — Steve here.

Last week we covered **Vibe Coding**. This week, let's talk about something you've probably heard but maybe never fully understood.

## This Week's Term: Windsurf

**The quick version:** Another AI code editor, known for smooth multi-file editing. Like Cursor's chill younger sibling.

**The deeper version:**

Windsurf is another AI-powered code editor, similar to Cursor but with its own personality. If Cursor is the power tool, Windsurf is the one that feels smoother and more intuitive. It's particularly good at working across multiple files at once — like when you need to change something that affects several parts of your project.

What makes Windsurf special is its "Cascade" feature, which can work through complex multi-step tasks. You tell it what you want at a high level, and it figures out which files to edit, what changes to make, and does it all in one flow. It's like having a junior developer who actually listens.

I used Windsurf extensively when I was building my first app. It was one of the tools that made me realize that vibe coding was real — that I could actually build things without being a traditional programmer.

## Why This Matters

Because the more AI coding tools you know about, the better equipped you are to find the one that clicks for you. Some people prefer Cursor, some prefer Windsurf, some use both. They're all trying to solve the same problem: making it easier for humans to build software with AI help.

## Try It Yourself (2 minutes)

Visit windsurf.com and watch their demo videos. Compare to Cursor and VS Code + Copilot — each takes a different approach to AI coding.

## The Nerd Corner

Windsurf (by Codeium) is a VS Code-based editor with deep AI integration. Its Cascade feature orchestrates multi-file edits using an agentic approach. It supports context-aware completions, natural language commands, and real-time collaboration with AI. The free tier is generous, making it accessible for beginners.
