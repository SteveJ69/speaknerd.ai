# SpeakNerd Weekly #32: AI Agent

**Subject line:** AI that doesn't just talk — it actually DOES things

---

Hey — Steve here.

Last week we covered **Alignment**. This week, let's talk about something you've probably heard but maybe never fully understood.

## This Week's Term: AI Agent

**The quick version:** An AI that doesn't just answer questions — it takes actions. The difference between a GPS that gives directions and a self-driving car that drives you there.

**The deeper version:**

A chatbot answers your questions. An AI agent does your errands.

Think of it this way: ChatGPT is like a really smart friend sitting on the couch giving you advice. "You should book a flight, then get a hotel, then reserve a restaurant." Helpful! But you still have to do all of it. An AI agent is like a personal assistant who hears "plan me a trip to Paris" and actually books the flight, reserves the hotel, and makes dinner reservations. It doesn't just think — it acts.

AI agents can browse the web, write and run code, send emails, manage files, call APIs, and chain together multiple steps to accomplish a goal. They're the next evolution beyond chatbots — moving from "AI that talks" to "AI that works." Some can even figure out the steps on their own without you spelling it out.

## Why This Matters

Because AI agents are about to change how work gets done. Instead of spending 30 minutes doing a multi-step task yourself, you describe what you want and the agent handles it. The people who learn to work WITH agents will get dramatically more done than those who don't. This is the shift from "AI as a tool" to "AI as a coworker."

## Try It Yourself (2 minutes)

Try a Zapier AI automation. Give it a multi-step task and watch it break the problem into steps and execute them.

## The Nerd Corner

AI agents are autonomous systems that use LLMs as reasoning engines combined with tool use capabilities (function calling, code execution, web browsing). They employ planning strategies like ReAct (Reasoning + Acting), chain-of-thought prompting, and tree-of-thought search. Key frameworks include LangChain, AutoGen, and CrewAI. Agent architectures typically involve a loop of observe → think → act → observe.
