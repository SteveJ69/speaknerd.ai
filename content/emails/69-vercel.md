# SpeakNerd Weekly #69: Vercel

**Subject line:** Deploy your website in 30 seconds (not kidding)

---

Hey — Steve here.

Last week we covered **Cloudflare**. This week, let's talk about something you've probably heard but maybe never fully understood.

## This Week's Term: Vercel

**The quick version:** A hosting platform that makes deploying websites stupidly easy. Push your code, boom — it's live.

**The deeper version:**

Remember how deploying used to mean renting servers, configuring them, and praying nothing breaks? Vercel said "what if we just... made that easy?"

Vercel is a hosting platform. You connect it to your code on GitHub, and every time you push changes, Vercel automatically builds your site and puts it on the internet. That's it. No server management. No configuration headaches. Push code, get a live URL in about 60 seconds.

They also created Next.js, one of the most popular web frameworks. So Vercel and Next.js work together like peanut butter and jelly. But Vercel can host pretty much any frontend framework.

## Why This Matters

Because Vercel removes one of the scariest parts of building a website — getting it online. If you're vibe coding a project, Vercel means you can focus on building features instead of figuring out servers. The free tier handles personal projects and small sites easily, so there's zero cost to get started.

## Try It Yourself (2 minutes)

Visit vercel.com, connect a GitHub repo. In ~30 seconds you'll have a live website. It really is that fast.
