# SpeakNerd Weekly #73: Product-Market Fit

**Subject line:** The moment everything clicks

---

Hey — Steve here.

Last week we covered **MVP**. This week, let's talk about something you've probably heard but maybe never fully understood.

## This Week's Term: Product-Market Fit

**The quick version:** The magical moment when people want your product so badly they'd be upset if you took it away. The hardest thing in startups.

**The deeper version:**

Imagine you set up a lemonade stand. If people walk by and shrug, you don't have product-market fit. If people are lined up around the block fighting for your lemonade — you've got it.

Product-market fit is the moment your product and your audience click. People don't just try it — they use it. They come back. They tell their friends. They'd be genuinely upset if you shut it down. It's the difference between "that's nice" and "I NEED this."

Before product-market fit, everything feels like pushing a boulder uphill. Marketing is expensive, growth is slow, and every customer feels hard-won. After product-market fit, things start pulling you forward — customers find you, word of mouth kicks in, and growth becomes the easy part.

## Why This Matters

Because finding product-market fit is the single most important thing for any new product. You can have the best marketing, the prettiest design, and the most advanced technology — but if people don't actually need what you built, none of it matters. If you're building something, obsess over this before anything else.

## Try It Yourself (2 minutes)

Think of an app you'd genuinely miss if it disappeared. It has product-market fit with you. Apps you downloaded but never opened? They didn't.

## The Nerd Corner

Marc Andreessen coined the modern usage: "Product-market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market." Sean Ellis' test: survey users asking "How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?" — if 40%+ say "very disappointed," you likely have PMF. Metrics indicating PMF include organic growth, high retention, low churn, and customers actively recommending the product.
